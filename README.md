A fantasy football tool that helps you draft your players.

## Fantasy Data

The app works by scraping the listed Average Draft Positions listed on [Fantasy Pros](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/adp).

## Controls

Choose your scoring system and adjust team/roster sizes as necessary from the settings menu. Click on a player to draft him. Once a player is drafted, you can select them again from the "picks" list to add them to your roster.

## Features

- Automatically saves your settings and progress so don't worry about accidentally refreshing
- Light and Dark modes available
- Player search and filtering by position
- Works great on mobile

## Potential Improvements

- Use more data sources
- Have team/roster sizes affect player rankings
- Make it easier to view the players on your roster
- Add "hide after drafting" option to completely remove a player from the rankings table after drafting
